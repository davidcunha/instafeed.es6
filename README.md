# instafeed.es6

Instafeed is a dead-simple way to add Instagram photos to your website. No jQuery required, just good 'ol plain javascript.

This is a continuation and a remake of [Steven Schobert's original instafeed.js](https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js) in order to provide ES6 support.

## :warning: IMPORTANT! Instagram is changing the API that Instafeed.js depends on.
